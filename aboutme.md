My name is Clive. I currently work as a programmer in an internet company. Here are a few qualities that define me:

* Interest in History and Economics: I love exploring how past events shape our world today.
* Enthusiasm for Learning: I'm always eager to discover new things, whether it's a skill or an interesting fact.
* Open-Mindedness: I embrace new experiences and ideas.
